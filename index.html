   <h1>Let's get to know each other!</h1>
   <h2>My history</h2>
   <p>My name is Tina Myers and I am a coding student at Code Fellows. I have a husband and 3 step sons, ages 15 (almost 16), 12, and 7. They are all working on remote learning right now, and doing really well! We live in Lynnwood, Washington, where it is beautiful this week!</p>
   <h3> Education </h3>
   <p>I have a lot of previous education. When I was younger I made multiple attempts at traditional college, but it didn't work for me each time I tried. So I worked, eventually completing school to be a physical therapist assistant. I worked full time while I was attending school full time. It was difficult, but I knew it's what I wanted to be doing, so I made it happen. I worked in physical therapy for about 4 years before covid hit and eliminated my position, as well as many other PTA's in various environments. Which led me to Plan B, in this case, coding school! Lets see what kinds of school I've attended in the past:
    <ul>
     <li> Currently coding bootcamp at Code Fellows</li>
     <li> I went to Pima Medical Institute in Seattle for my PTA degree</li>
     <li> Working on my associates with a plan to enter into engineering</li>
     <li> Random schooling after high school with many areas of interest (political science, psychology, languages, ect)</li>
    </ul>   
   <h3>Work Experience</h3>
   <p> While I was doing all of the schooling (present schooling excluded), I was working as well. Here's some of my work history:
    <ul>
     <li> Life Care Center of Kirkland
     <li> Slot Attendant at Snoqualmie Casino
     <li> Cage cashier at Tulalip Casino
     <li> Assistant manager at Blockbuster (I know, it's a throwback)
    </ul>
   <p> In Code Fellows, I hope to learn how to create a webpage from start to finish, and learn enough about coding to be able to tinker and develop a mobile app for my husband's new small business. We have a plan/hope of being able to work remotely and travel, being able to work from an area for weeks at a time and explore in our free time, without having to worry about "vacation time".</p>
