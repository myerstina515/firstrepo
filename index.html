   <h1>Let's get to know each other!</h1>
   <h2>My history</h2>
   <p>My name is Tina Myers and I am a coding student at Code Fellows. I have a husband and 3 step sons, ages 15 (almost 16), 12, and 7. They are all working on remote learning right now, and doing really well! We live in Lynnwood, Washington, where it is beautiful this week!</p>
   <h2> Education </h2>
   <p>I have a lot of previous education. When I was younger I made multiple attempts at traditional college, but it didn't work for me each time I tried. So I worked, eventually completing school to be a physical therapist assistant. I worked full time while I was attending school full time. It was difficult, but I knew it's what I wanted to be doing, so I made it happen. I worked in physical therapy for about 4 years before covid hit and eliminated my position, as well as many other PTA's in various environments. Which led me to Plan B, in this case, coding school! Lets see what kinds of school I've attended in the past:
    <ul>
     <li> Currently coding bootcamp at Code Fellows</li>
     <li> I went to Pima Medical Institute in Seattle for my PTA degree</li>
     <li> Working on my associates with a plan to enter into engineering</li>
     <li> Random schooling after high school with many areas of interest (political science, psychology, languages, ect)</li>
    </ul>   
   <h2>Work Experience</h2>
   <p> While I was doing all of the schooling (present schooling excluded), I was working as well. Here's some of my work history:
    <ul>
     <li> Life Care Center of Kirkland
     <li> Slot Attendant at Snoqualmie Casino
     <li> Cage cashier at Tulalip Casino
     <li> Assistant manager at Blockbuster (I know, it's a throwback)
    </ul>
   <p> In Code Fellows, I hope to learn how to create a webpage from start to finish, and learn enough about coding to be able to tinker and develop a mobile app for my husband's new small business. We have a plan/hope of being able to work remotely and travel, being able to work from an area for weeks at a time and explore in our free time, without having to worry about "vacation time".</p> 
   <h2>My top 10 list of countries I want to explore while working remote</h2>
   <p>There are many more than just ten places I'd like to be able to work remotely from. The following list is my top ten list of countries my husband and I have talked about exploring while being able to manage remote work. Lets just dive right into the top 10, and I'll explain a little after each one.</p>
    <ol>
     <li><b>Japan:</b> My husband is part Japanese, and has done lots of learning about the Japanese culture. We would love to do an extended visit to see all that Japan has to offer.</li>
     <li><b>Italy:</b> From the history to the culture and the clear blue water to the wineries. Both of us individually have always wanted to go.</li>
     <li><b>Egypt:</b> The pyramids, of course, but there is so much more history to Egypt than just the Pyramids of Giza.</li>
     <li><b>India:</b> Several friends in my friend group moved here from India, and between the history and culture, as well as the food, I would love to spend some time there.</li>
     <li><b>Germany:</b> Many of my ancestors came from Germany, so there is that obvious allure, but there are also the mountains, the art and museums, and the culture.</li>
     <li><b>Peru:</b> Machu Picchu. Need I say more? Oh, ok. Well, it's also simliar in time zones to the US, so work time is more compatible, and add in some amazing Peruvian food, and it sound pretty good!</li>
     <li><b>New Zealand/Austrailia:</b> I don't think this needs an explaination.</li>
     <li><b>England/Scotland/Ireland:</b> The trinity. I also have a substantial amount of ancestry from here, so I'm curious to see all three areas to try to imagine having lived there.</li>
     <li><b>Thailand:</b> City, beach, and country all in one.</li>
     <li><b>France:</b> The stereotypical reasons, including Paris, the Eiffel Tower, and the Louvre.</li>
    </ol>
